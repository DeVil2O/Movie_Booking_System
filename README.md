" Movie Theatre Booking System " the goal of this project is to develop the backend service for the ticket booking system for the theatre counter. I have   implemented the services in "GO" programming language which can handle upto 1 million requests per second without use of any framework and the database used is "Mongo DB" which is very efficient working database for the management of any type of requests. According to the project, there is admin window which will be provide every service related to the ticket booking. The services including in the project are as follows : 

* Book a ticket using a user’s name, phone number, and timings
* Can also update the ticket timings
* View all the tickets for a particular time
* Delete a particular ticket
* View the user’s details based on the ticket id
* Mark a ticket as expired if there is a diff of 8 hours between the ticket timing and current time
